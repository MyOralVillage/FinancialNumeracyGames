        the appropriate directory, add a strings.xml file, and translate these

        Similarly, to add a new country change the following information to be appropriate

        Note that locale and country are, for the moment, essentially identical

        Cannot create an array of arrays so create a single dimensional array with elements separated by commas
        The first element is the name (basically just a comment at this point, it is used in any errors reported)
        the second element is the price of the item as a floating point number. This is used in BOTH currency games
        The third element is the amount given in the Change currency game

        Note that BOTH the first and second element MUST be able to be EXACTLY expressed in the currency units.
        So, for example, if the lowest bill is 100 then ALL amounts must be in multiples of 100.

        Also, the second number MUST be strictly greater than the first
        TODO : Do we want to allow the second to be identical to the first? Ie, allow a person to expect
               to receive NO change
